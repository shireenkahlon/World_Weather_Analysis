# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
This project is used in conjunction with a travel website to allow travelers to choose places to visit based on their preferred weather. For example, somebody could choose 110 degrees farenheit as a maximum temperature in June and choose to go to Austin, Texas, or choose maximum 50 degree weather and choose to go to Chile in the same time frame. This challenge is an update to the VacationPy and WeatherPy projects. In this segment, a weather description is added so travelers can view the current weather (ex: cloudy, windy, rainy, and so on). The possible cities based on their preferences as well as the description is shown by using Googleâ€™s API in conjunction with their Google Places url. The locations are shown with keys which can be clicked on to view current weather information. In the final part of this project, the website will show nearby hotels to destinations a traveler may want to visit as well as routes between locations.
